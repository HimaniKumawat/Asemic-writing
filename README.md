# Asemic-writing
computer generated asemic writing (using arduino and p5). This is influenced by the surrounding noise.
Things used in this project:
Arduino Uno
Jumper wires
Microphone sensor- 4 pin
Screen to present the output

Connect the Arduino to p5 with the help of p5-serialcontrol application. Download and install all the files from the link below-
https://github.com/p5-serial/p5.serialcontrol/releases/tag/0.1.2

Connect the microphone sensor with the arduino:
Sensor - Arduino
Digital pin - A0
Ground - Ground
Positive current - 5V or 3.3V
